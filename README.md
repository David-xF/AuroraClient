# AuroraClient
I do not recommend using this client because it has a poor implementation and tends to crash randomly, which is a frequent occurrence.

This client will not receive any updates from me because I am currently working on a new project. [`Negative Client`](https://github.com/David-xF/NegativeClient). (If it says "Not Found," then it means that the project is still in progress.)
