# AuroraClient
I do not Recommend to use this Client. Why? Because the Implementation is **Really Bad**, and the Client can/will Crash at Random which is Really Bad because of how often it Happens. So yea.

This Client will **not** Receive any Updates from me, because i currently work on a New Project [`Negative Client`](https://github.com/David-xF/NegativeClient). (If it says not Found then it's still in Progress.)
